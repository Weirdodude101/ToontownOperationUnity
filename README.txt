Some things peeps should know before altering the project~

- In order to import animations or models, you MUST use Maya2016. Any other format will be rejected.
- All code must be in C#.
- Do not attempt to steal code, or you will be given a DMCA written document, which will approve of the termination of your account and an IP ban.
- Please list every change you've made in your commit, or it will be reversed.
- Have fun!
